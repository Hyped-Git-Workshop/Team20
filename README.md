# Git Exercise

1. Each person in the pair needs to `git clone` this repo
2. Decide, who is Person A and who is Person B
3. Tasks will be appearing below. After you complete one, another one appears. There is 10 in total.
4. First 6 tasks are always only for one person (it alternates between A and B)
5. In the remaining tasks, you will work in parallel and might even need to resolve some conflicts.

## Tasks
1. Person A - `pod.cpp` - Name your pod
    * Open `pod.cpp` file and locate TASK 1
    * Type the name for your pod inside the double-quotes (you should discuss the choice of the name with your teammate)
2. Person B - `pod.cpp` - Choose max speed
    * Open `pod.cpp` file and locate TASK 2
    * Tell us what the max speed of your pod is by replacing the 0 in the code with a real number
3. Person A - `pod.h` and `pod.cpp` - Tempereture inside the pressure vessel
    * Open `pod.h`, locate place for TASKS 3&4 and copy-paste the following line there
        ```c++
        double get_temperature();
        ```
    * Open `pod.cpp`, locate place for TASKS 3&4 and copy-paste the following code there (you can change the 0 there if you want a more comfortable temperature)
        ```c++
        double Pod::get_temperature()
        {
          return 0;
        }
        ```
    * When done, commit both files in a single commit (ofc don't forget push and stuff as always)
4. Person B - `pod.h` and `pod.cpp` - Pressure inside the pressure vessel
    * Open `pod.h`, locate place for TASKS 3&4 and copy-paste the following line below the one from previous task
        ```c++
        double get_pressure();
        ```
    * Open `pod.cpp`, locate place for TASKS 3&4, copy the following code and paste it below the function from previous task (you can change the 0 there if you want a more comfortable pressure)
        ```c++
        double Pod::get_pressure()
        {
          return 0;
        }
        ```
    * When done, commit both files in a single commit (ofc don't forget push and stuff as always)
5. Person A - `main.cpp` and `Makefile` - Main executable
    * Create a new file called `main.cpp` and copy the following code to it
        ```c++
        #include <iostream>
        #include "pod.h"

        int main()
        {
          Pod pod;
          std::cout << "Name: " << pod.get_name() << std::endl;
          std::cout << "Maximum speed: " << pod.get_max_speed() << std::endl;
          std::cout << "Temperature: " << pod.get_temperature() << std::endl;
          std::cout << "Pressure: " << pod.get_pressure() << std::endl;
          return 0;
        }
        ```
    * Open `Makefile`, locate place for TASK 4 and uncomment the code there to get something like
        ```mk
        main : main.o pod.o bms.o navigation.o accelerometer.o
	        $(CC) $(OBJS) $(LFLAGS) main.o -o main

        main.o : main.cpp pod.h bms.h navigation.h accelerometer.h
	        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.cpp
        ```
    * Notice the difference in the output of `git status` for the newly created file
    * Commit `main.cpp` and `Makefile` in separate commits
6. Person B - `bms.cpp`, `bms.h` and `Makefile` - Battery management system
    * Create a new file called `bms.h` and copy the following code to it
        ```c++
        #ifndef HYPED_GIT_WSHOP_BMS_H
        #define HYPED_GIT_WSHOP_BMS_H
        
        
        class BatteryManagementSystem
        {
          public:
            BatteryManagementSystem();
        
            /// TASKS 9 (BOTH) /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
            
            /// END OF TASKS 9AB ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        };
        
        
        #endif //HYPED_GIT_WSHOP_BMS_H
        ```
    * Create a new file called `bms.cpp` and copy the following code to it
        ```c++
        #include "bms.h"

        BatteryManagementSystem::BatteryManagementSystem()
        {
        }

        /// TASK 9 (BOTH) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        
        /// END OF TASKS 9AB ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        ```
    * Open `Makefile`, locate place for TASK 5 and uncomment the code there to get something like
        ```mk
        bms.o : bms.cpp bms.h
	        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) bms.cpp
        ```
    * Notice the difference in the output of `git status` for the newly created file
    * Commit `bms.h` and `bms.cpp` in one commit and `Makefile` in separate commits

    - Person A - `accelerometer.h` - Define accelerometer's error
        * Open `accelerometer.h`, locate place for TASK 7 and edit the line so that it looks something like below (0 is best but also most boring)
